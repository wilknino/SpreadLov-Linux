I want you to update my existing SpreadLov project so that it can run directly on a Linux VM at /opt/spreadlov as spreadlov.com. Currently, the project was created using Replit AI and has the following structure:

Project uses Node.js (ES Modules), Vite, React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript.

The project has a server/index.ts for backend.

The frontend is built with Vite + React.

PostgreSQL is required for the database.

Requirements for the updated project:

Linux VM Ready: All paths should assume the project lives at /opt/spreadlov.

Backend Adjustments: Update server/index.ts and any configuration to:

Use ES Modules properly (__dirname issues fixed).

Use .env for database credentials and port configuration.

Default to port 5000 for Node.js server.

Catch EADDRINUSE errors or give clear logs if the port is in use.

Frontend Adjustments:

Vite build output goes to /opt/spreadlov/dist/public.

Path aliases properly resolved.

PostgreSQL Integration: Use the following credentials:

Database: spreadlovdb

Username: psql

Password: T=[ab!Bu5H{gV.ZN

Host: localhost

Port: 5432

Provide instructions in requirement.txt to install PostgreSQL if needed.

Nginx + SSL Ready: Assume Nginx will serve the app with reverse proxy at spreadlov.com and SSL via Let’s Encrypt.

Dependencies Management:

Generate a requirement.txt file listing all system requirements (Node.js, npm, PostgreSQL, build tools, nginx, certbot, etc.) and all NPM packages from package.json.

Environment Configuration:

Provide .env file template for database credentials and server port.

Build & Run Instructions:

Include instructions in requirement.txt on how to build (npm install && npm run build) and run (node dist/index.js) the project on Linux VM.

Clean & Direct Deployment:

Make sure that after Replit updates the project, I can upload all files to /opt/spreadlov, run npm install, npm run build, and node dist/index.js and it will work without additional code changes.

Output Expected From You (Replit AI):

Updated project files ready for Linux VM deployment.

requirement.txt with full prerequisites.

.env template.

Clear instructions on running the project.

Make sure all ES Module issues (__dirname) are fixed, PostCSS/TailwindCSS builds properly, and the project works with Node.js v20 and PostgreSQL on Linux.
